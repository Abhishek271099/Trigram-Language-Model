We will be making a simple Trigram character level Language Model.
Trigram model takes the 2 characters and predicts the third character.
Dataset contains the names and will be decomposed into trigrams.
Example of Trigram:
    Name: abhishek
    Trigrams: (a, b, h), (b, h, i), (h, i, s), (i, s, h), (s, h, e), (h, e, k)
